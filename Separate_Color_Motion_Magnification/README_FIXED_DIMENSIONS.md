# Fixed Dimensions for Video Processing Output

## Problem

When processing larger videos, the output would become distorted with videos becoming too small and graphs too small to read, with excessive padding between them. This was because the dimensions were scaled based on the input video's dimensions and length, causing inconsistent output sizes.

## Solution

The code has been modified to use fixed dimensions for the output video and graphs, ensuring consistent sizing regardless of the input video length or resolution.

### Key Changes:

1. **Fixed Base Width**: Set a consistent width of 640px for each video column (1920px total for 3 columns)
2. **Fixed Video Height**: Set a consistent height of 360px for the video display area
3. **Fixed Plot Dimensions**: Each plot is now exactly 640px wide and 300px high
4. **Guaranteed Minimum Layout**: Enforced a minimum of 3 rows for graph layout
5. **Consistent Aspect Ratio**: Maintained aspect ratio of input videos within their fixed columns
6. **Improved Graph Scaling**: Modified graph functions to use fixed scaling and dimensions
7. **Proportional Point Tracking**: Improved how the tracking points scale with different data lengths

### Verification:

Output video dimensions are now consistently:

- Width: 1920px (3 columns of 640px)
- Height: 1260px (360px video + 3 rows of 300px plots)
- Aspect ratio: 1.52

### Benefits:

- All outputs have consistent dimensions regardless of input
- Graphs are large enough to read clearly
- Videos maintain their aspect ratio within fixed space
- Tracking points properly scale with different data lengths

## Usage

No changes are needed to use this improved version. The code will automatically use the fixed dimensions for all outputs.

For testing different video lengths or resolutions, edit `config.py` and modify the `INPUT_VIDEO_PATH`.

## Testing

To verify the dimensions of output videos, run:

```
python3 /Users/naveenmirapuri/VideoProcessing/Separate_Color_Motion_Magnification/check_output.py
```
